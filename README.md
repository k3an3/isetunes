# isetunes
Web frontend for any music player, using Python3.7+/Flask with authentication, allowing users to request and vote on songs. Supports whatever backend/music service you're willing to write the API calls for.

Version 2.0 has been in the works for some time (on the burner in the way back). Highlights include:
* Reorganized as Python package
* Easier configuration/setup
* Add Spotify Web API. This allows an existing Spotify Client to be controlled instead of requiring a separate music server to be set up.
* Maybe more? Idk, it was long ago that I started...
